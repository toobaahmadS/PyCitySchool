## Background

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Before You Begin

Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.
Clone the new repository to your computer.
Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for this homework assignment and name it PyCitySchools.
Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.
Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Instructions

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.
Hint: Check out the sample solution called PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb located in the .zip file to review the desired format for this assignment.

## District Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
Include the following:
Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## School Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
Include the following:
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
